    <h2>The 9-5(ish)</h2>
    <p>Having worked in advertising planning & strategy for 4 years, I decided to take a risk and (try to) learn how to code. Ideally I'd like to be able to work in a hybrid role at an early stage start-up where I can put both planning and coding skill-sets to good use!</p>

    <div class="container">
    <h2>Adventure</h2>
    <p>I'm always looking for my next adventure, whether it's motorbiking the highest roads in the world or driving from coast to coast of the USA. Passionate about travelling the world.</p>
